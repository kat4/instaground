#Instaground documentation

##Concept

To create a web-based app, with a dynamic page background which updates by using search criteria and the instagram api.

We will look to use have a second tab, which shows the user the images from their previous searches in that session.

This will primarily be a mobile app, which will also look good and function on larger devices.

[ ] Implement a search box with a submit button which loads a new image based on the search term.

[ ] Add tab functionality, and a basic second tab.

[ ] Use cookies stores user's search history on second tab.

[ ] Dynamic functionality to search bar.
